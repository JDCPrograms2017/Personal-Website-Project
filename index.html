        <p>Since age 12, I've dabbled in many coding languages for various different projects to test and expand upon my knowledge. 
          Here are some of my most practiced languages and the applications in which I've implimented them! <strong>(Everything I list can be found on my GitHub)</strong>

              <h1>Python</h1>
              <p>I've used Python in most of my projects to date. It's what really got me into learning the importance of data structures, and it acted
                 as a gateway to my fascination with <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. I've used Python in making simple games like Rock, Paper, Scissors, all the way
                 into projects with AI and machine learning such as inferencing a <strong>YOLOv5 model</strong> for object detection, using
                 <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> to find trends in house pricing with a mock dataset.

            <div id="java">
              <h1>Java</h1>
              <p>Java was what started it all for me. As a 12 year old kid, I wanted to know what made the popular game, Minecraft, tick.
                 I also wanted to know how I could modify it, because I knew that if you can make something on a computer, you should be able to modify it.
                 My parents bought me a class onine and off I went learning <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> at age 12! If I had the code to my first Minecraft mod,
                 I would link it on my GitHub but unfortunately it has been lost to time.

              <h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
              <p>My interests in <strong>Web Development</strong> go back to when I was 14 years old and wanted to make a new website for my mom's business. 
                 I love being creative and doing things by myself without the aid of some website-builder, so I took some classes and got to
                 know <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> quite well!</p>
